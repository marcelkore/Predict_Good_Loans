# Predict_Good_Loans
Project that builds a machine learning model for predicting customers that would pay back a loan for a bank. 
The project is spread across three notebooks; Exploratory Phase, Data Cleaning and Model Selection/Building. 
The files heavily rely on the helpers files containing different functions to perform different tasks.
